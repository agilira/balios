# Changelog - Version 1.1.1

## Release Date
2025-10-21

## Overview
Important stability release addressing thread safety issues identified under specific high-concurrency scenarios following the v1.0.0 release. 
This version resolves potential data races and a nil pointer dereference to improve robustness and prevent panics in demanding workloads.

## #Corrected
- **Thread Safety:**
  - Hardened concurrent access to entry metadata (key, keyHash) using atomic operations to prevent data races reported under heavy load.
  - Corrected potential negative value in the cache size counter during concurrent operations.
  - Improved synchronization logic for specific concurrent Set/Delete/Get patterns.
- **Memory Safety:**
  - Fixed a potential nil pointer dereference during Delete operations under certain race conditions (cache.go:321).
  - Reviewed pointer handling in key storage for improved safety under concurrency.

## #Acknowledgment
Ensuring thread safety in high-performance concurrent code is challenging. 
We appreciate the community feedback and stress-testing following the v1.0.0 release, which helped identify these specific edge cases. 
This release significantly improves the stability of Balios under high contention. 
We remain committed to providing a robust and performant code.

## #Files Changed
- `cache.go` - Addressed nil pointer and strengthened atomic access.
- `race_test.go` - Added new test cases covering reported high-concurrency scenarios.

## #Compatibility
- **API Compatible**: No breaking changes to public interfaces.
- **Go Version**: 1.23+ (unchanged).
- **Behavior**: Improved stability under high concurrency. Performance impact expected to be minimal, prioritizing correctness.
