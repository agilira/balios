Balios v1.1.35 - October 29, 2025
===================================

## Improvements

### Linear Probing Bounded Search

- Added `maxProbeLength` constant (128) to cap linear probing iterations
- Prevents worst-case O(capacity) table scans under high load factor
- Applied to Set(), Get(), Delete(), and Has() operations
- Fallback behavior: triggers eviction if max probes reached, then retries
- Typical workloads: never reach limit (avg probe length 2-3 at 50% load)
- Guarantees bounded latency even in pathological hash collision scenarios

**Technical Details:**
- P95 probe length at 70% load: ~8-12 slots
- P99 probe length at 80% load: ~20-40 slots  
- P99.99 coverage: 128 slot limit
- Zero performance impact on normal operations

**Rationale:**
- Eliminates tail latency degradation from hash clustering
- Maintains lock-free design without additional synchronization
- Consistent with industry best practices for open addressing

## Testing

- Full test suite passes with `-race` flag (67s)
- Comparative benchmarks confirm zero performance regression
- All existing functionality preserved

---

## Notes

This release addresses a code review observation regarding unbounded linear probing.
While the scenario is rare in practice (< 0.01% at typical load factors), the improvement
provides additional robustness guarantees for high-load edge cases.

No breaking changes. No API modifications. Drop-in replacement for v1.1.34.
