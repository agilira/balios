v1.1.36 - 2025-10-29

BUG FIXES:
- Fixed race condition in bounded probing fallback under extreme concurrency
  - When 100+ goroutines update same key, bounded probing (128 slots) may not find it
  - Added full table scan with retry logic (up to 5 attempts) when key exists beyond probe limit
  - If key found, update in-place instead of evicting
  - Added runtime.Gosched() on CAS failures to reduce contention
  - Prevents key loss during high-contention concurrent updates
  - All security tests now pass including TestSecurity_RaceConditionAttacks

- Clarified Has() TTL behavior in documentation
  - Has() correctly checks TTL and returns false for expired entries
  - Added complete test coverage for Has() with TTL
  - Updated interface documentation to explicitly mention TTL behavior
