v1.1.36 - 2025-01-29

BUG FIX:
- Fixed race condition in bounded probing fallback under extreme concurrency
  - When 100+ goroutines update same key, bounded probing (128 slots) may not find it
  - Added full table scan before eviction to check if key exists anywhere
  - If key found beyond probe limit, update in-place instead of evicting
  - Prevents key loss during high-contention concurrent updates
  - All security tests now pass including TestSecurity_RaceConditionAttacks
